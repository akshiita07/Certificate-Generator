# Certificate-Generator
This project utilizes the PDF-lib library to create customized certificates dynamically. Users input their names into a form, and upon submission, the application fetches a base PDF template from a server. The PDF-lib library is then used to load this template, overlay the user's name onto the certificate, and generate a new PDF.
